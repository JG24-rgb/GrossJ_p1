        <p class="body-copy">After spending many years in the overnight distribution, transport, and retail industries, Mark Grey founded MGBD Parts &amp; Services in late 2010, driven by his passion for Rover P6 cars produced between 1963 and 1977. By the end of 2010, he was repairing, servicing, and restoring P6s for others while also holding an active volunteer committee position in a classic car club since 1994. In August 2012, we launched our webstore, initially offering just 26 new Rover P6 parts. Today, in 2024, we stock over 2500 new products and have an extensive selection of refurbished and second-hand parts, all aimed at keeping the Rover P6 alive and on the road. We are continuously investing in the remanufacturing of obsolete parts and are gradually expanding our range to include other Rover models.</p>
